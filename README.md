# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset

This project focuses on studying and applying data preprocessing techniques on the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning training. The following steps are included:

Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Performing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset structure and insights using functions such as:
head()
tail()
describe()
shape
Preparing the dataset to enhance its readiness for training machine learning algorithms for survival prediction.
